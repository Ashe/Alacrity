TO PULL ( Get the files that you want to work with) Either :

- Go to http://github.com/crysikrend/P4G and 'clone'

- Download git portable ( https://git-scm.com/download/win ) and type:
	git clone http://github.com/crysikrend/P4G

OR IF IT'S ALREADY DOWNLOADED, navigate to that folder in git portable and type
	git pull
- this will pull all new changes.

----------------------------------------
TO UPLOAD

- Navigate to the assignment in the git portable terminal (section below)
- type:
	~      git add .

	~      git commit -m"type a message here about what you have done"

	~      git push
----------------------------------------
TO NAVIGATE

- Open the git-bash terminal
- type cd to change directory (example: cd P4G-master    will find a file in the current folder called P4G master and go into it
- type cd .. to go up a folder

When you clone, it clones into the folder you are in, and when you push / pull, make sure you are in the assignment directory else it won't work!

GOOD LUCK!
